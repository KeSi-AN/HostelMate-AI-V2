## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#483D8B) to convey trust and intellectual atmosphere.
- Background color: Very light grayish-indigo (#F0F0FA). It is slightly off-white to ensure enough contrast for readability and accessibility.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#947BD3), slightly less saturated and lighter than the primary, providing contrast without overwhelming the interface.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Clean, geometric icons from a consistent set to maintain visual uniformity and convey information effectively.
- Mobile-first responsive layout with clear content hierarchy and intuitive navigation.
- Subtle transition animations for smooth user interactions and feedback. Should not distract from the functionality of the web application.
